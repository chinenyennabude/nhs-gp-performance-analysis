**NHS GP Appointment Data Analysis (England)**

**Project Overview**

This project analyses publicly available NHS GP appointment data to explore patterns in primary care demand across England. The analysis focuses on transforming complex, non-standard reporting tables into a clean analytical dataset and identifying trends that could support operational planning and healthcare service delivery.

Real-world NHS datasets are often distributed in reporting formats rather than analysis-ready structures. This project demonstrates how raw statistical publications can be converted into structured datasets suitable for analysis, insight generation, and future automation.

**Objectives**

Clean and standardise NHS GP appointment datasets

Transform reporting tables into analysis-ready format

Handle multi-sheet Excel files with non-standard headers

Create reusable data cleaning functions

Explore appointment activity trends over time

Apply reproducible analytical workflow principles

**🗂 Dataset**

Source: NHS England Open Data
Dataset: Monthly GP Appointment Statistics

The dataset includes:

Appointment volumes by month

Delivery type (face-to-face, telephone, etc.)

National-level operational activity metrics

Multiple Excel workbooks containing structured reporting tables (e.g., Table 1a)

Key challenge:

Column names were embedded within rows and required restructuring before analysis.

**🛠 Tools & Technologies**

Python

Pandas – data cleaning & transformation

NumPy – numerical handling

Jupyter Notebook
